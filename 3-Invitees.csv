// Others
Ryu, Sukyoung, KAIST, South Korea  // as far as I know, she is interested in building an analysis framework for Rust
Miné, Antoine, Sorbonne Université, France // recent projects on abstract interpretation for Rust
Monniaux, David, Verimag, France // same as above, as well as static analyses for compilation
Pasareanu, Corina, Carnegie Mellon University, USA // Automated testing of Rust libraries
Li, Guanyuan, Huawei, Hong Kong // Pushing for Rust analysis at Huawei
Wang, Yuting, Jiaotong University, China // recent work on formal verification for Rust
Yuan, Shenghao, Zhejiang University, China // Trying to translate Rust to Isabelle/HOL
Delmas, David, Airbus, France // Both are using static analysis tools (Astrée) in industrial settings
Fontayne, Rémy, Airbus, France  // and have ongoing experiments with Rust analysis for embedded systems
Donaldson, Alastair, Imperial College London, UK // Compiler testing for Rust

// What about people working on related ideas for other languages: Linear Dafny, OxCaml, Carbon, Swift (aside from Dafny, there is not much verification there, as far as I know)
// JP: I'm on the fence about this -- what is the reasoning for other languages being relevant for
// Rust analysis tools? maybe inform the design of Rust...? then perhaps we could consider https://safecpp.org/draft.html
// What about people building the infrastructure used by some Rust verifiers, Coma, Viper, Why3
// JP: I'm sympathetic to that
// What about people from the Rust language/compiler team, in particular, Niko Matsakis and Felix Klock
// JP: yes to Niko -- not sure if Felix is interested in these academic-ish endeavors, but worth a
// try, I'm asking around to see who else might be good candidates

// Yusuke Matsushita -- he was behind the prophecy variables... and the RustHornBelt work

// People from Ferrocenous?
