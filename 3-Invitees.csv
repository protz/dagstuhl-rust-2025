// BP: I can ask around.  Celina has been shifted to work on Rust compilation times, but she might still be interested.
// Kani (not sure who's best to invite)
// BP: Update: Michael Tautschnig recently gave a talk on the Rust verification competition and mentioned
//     he's working on pushing the Rust spec effort ahead, so we should definitely keep him on the list.

// BP: At least for the initial wave of invites, I think we should focus on Rust work.
//     Otherwise, the lines get very blurry.  For example, we might start bringing in
/      people working on SAT and SMT solvers, which seems like it's getting far afield.
// What about people working on related ideas for other languages: Linear Dafny, OxCaml, Carbon, Swift (aside from Dafny, there is not much verification there, as far as I know)
// JP: I'm on the fence about this -- what is the reasoning for other languages being relevant for
// Rust analysis tools? maybe inform the design of Rust...? then perhaps we could consider https://safecpp.org/draft.html
// What about people building the infrastructure used by some Rust verifiers, Coma, Viper, Why3
// JP: I'm sympathetic to that

// JP: could not determine who Felix Klock works for now, so I left him out

// How about some people from DARPA TRACTOR -- Bryan, are you on this and can
// you suggest folks? I only know about Mike Carbin
