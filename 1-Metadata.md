With the explosion of popularity of the Rust language, a flurry of new research
has appeared in the programming language and program semantics field. Notably,
because the type system of Rust provides so many guarantees "for free", many
tasks, such as program verification or program analysis, become much easier with
the Rust programming language.

In spite of the emergence of new tools and techniques, all of these efforts
remain independent, with little sharing of information and/or knowledge. The
goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar is to bring together all authors, developers and
researchers that are involved in tools for Rust program analysis, including, but
not limited to, program verification, model checking, static analyses, and so
on.

We expect that this seminar will allow for new collaborations, hopefully some
factorization of common engineering tasks, and the creation of a new community
that could capture the Rust program analysis endeavor at large, beyond simply
verification.
