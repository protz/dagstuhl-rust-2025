The Rust programming language has exploded in popularity,
due to its unique combination of strong performance and the static satefy
provided by Rust's ownership type system. This, in turn, has motivated a flurry of new research
on program analysis and verification, aiming to leverage Rust's guarantees 
to substantially simplify reasoning. This has created an exciting opportunity to push these techniques into the mainstream
of program development.

While many new research tools and techniques have emerged, these efforts
have largely proceeded independently, with knowledge exchanged primarily
through static conference papers.
The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar is to bring together the authors, developers and
researchers who are involved in techniques and tools for Rust program analysis, including, but
not limited to, program verification, model checking, and static analyses.

We expect that this seminar will foster new collaborations, catalyze
collective work on building analysis infrastructures, and create a new community
that captures the Rust program analysis endeavor at large.
