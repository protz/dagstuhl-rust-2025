The Rust programming language has exploded in popularity,
due to its unique combination of strong performance, low-level flexibility,
and high-level features and guarantees.
This, in turn, has motivated a flurry of new research
in the programming language and program semantics field. Notably,
because Rust's type system provides so many guarantees "for free", many
tasks, such as program verification or program analysis, become much easier in Rust,
creating an exciting opportunity to push these techniques into the mainstream
of program development.

While many new research tools and techniques have emerged, these efforts
have largely proceeded independently, with knowledge exchanged primarily
through static conference papers.
The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar is to bring together all authors, developers and
researchers who are involved in tools for Rust program analysis, including, but
not limited to, program verification, model checking, and static analyses.

We expect that this seminar will foster new collaborations, catalyze
collective work on common engineering tasks, and create a new community
that captures the Rust program analysis endeavor at large.
